# Project 1: C - Variables, if, else, while

## Description
This project covers foundational C programming concepts around variables, control flow, and iteration. You will practice declaring and assigning variables, using relational/logical operators, branching with `if` / `if...else`, and iterating with `while`. You will also work with ASCII and basic numeric/character output using `putchar`.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- Arithmetic, relational and logical (boolean) operators in C
- What values are considered `true` and `false` in C
- How to use `if` and `if...else` statements
- How to declare and assign variables of types `char`, `int`, `unsigned int`
- How to print variables with `printf` (when allowed)
- How to write `while` loops and use variables inside loops
- The ASCII character set
- The purpose of the GCC flags `-m32` and `-m64`

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using: gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
- You are not allowed to use `system`
- Your code should use the Betty style (`betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`)

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `0-positive_or_negative.c` | Prints whether a random number `n` is positive, zero, or negative. |
| `1-last_digit.c` | Prints the last digit of a random number `n` with a message based on its value. |
| `2-print_alphabet.c` | Prints the lowercase alphabet followed by a new line (using `putchar` only). |
| `3-print_alphabets.c` | Prints the lowercase alphabet, then uppercase, followed by a new line (using `putchar` only). |
| `4-print_alphabt.c` | Prints the lowercase alphabet except `q` and `e` (using `putchar` only). |
| `5-print_numbers.c` | Prints all single-digit base 10 numbers starting from 0, followed by a new line. |
| `6-print_numberz.c` | Prints all single-digit base 10 numbers starting from 0 (no `char` variables; `putchar` only). |
| `7-print_tebahpla.c` | Prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line (`putchar` only). |
| `8-print_base16.c` | Prints all base 16 numbers (0â€“9, aâ€“f) in lowercase, followed by a new line (`putchar` only). |
| `9-print_comb.c` | Prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, separated by `, ` in ascending order (`putchar` constraints). |
| `100-print_comb3.c` | **Advanced** â€“ Prints all different combinations of two digits in ascending order (two digits, no duplicates like `10` if `01` exists; `putchar` constraints). |
| `101-print_comb4.c` | **Advanced** â€“ Prints all different combinations of three digits in ascending order (no duplicates; `putchar` constraints). |
| `102-print_comb5.c` | **Advanced** â€“ Prints all combinations of two two-digit numbers (00â€“99), in ascending order with formatting rules; `putchar` constraints. |
