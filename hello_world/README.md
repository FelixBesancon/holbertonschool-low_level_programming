# Project 0: C - Hello, World

## Description
This project introduces the basics of C programming: understanding the compilation process, the role of the preprocessor, compiler, assembler and linker, and writing simple C programs using standard functions.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- What is a compiler and what are the steps of the compilation process
- What is a C program entry point (`main`)
- What are header files and how to use them
- How to compile C code using `gcc`
- The difference between a script and a compiled program
- How to print text in C using `printf` and `puts`
- How to get the size of data types using `sizeof`

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the options: `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file at the root of each folder is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style (checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`)
- No global variables allowed
- No more than 5 functions per file

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `0-preprocessor` | Script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file |
| `1-compiler` | Script that compiles a C file but does not link |
| `2-assembler` | Script that generates the assembly code of a C file |
| `3-name` | Script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun` |
| `4-puts.c` | C program that prints a string using the function `puts` |
| `5-printf.c` | C program that prints a string using `printf` |
| `6-size.c` | C program that prints the size of various data types |
| `100-intel` | Script that generates assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C file |
| `101-quote.c` | C program that prints a message to standard error without using `printf` or `puts` |
